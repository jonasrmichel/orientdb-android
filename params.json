{"tagline":"Android Port of OrientDB: A NoSQL Document Graph DBMS","body":"ORIENTDB-ANDROID\r\n================\r\n\r\n![Feature Image](https://github.com/wuman/orientdb-android/raw/master/doc/images/orientdb-android-logo.png)\r\n\r\nOrientDB-Android is a port/fork of [OrientDB](http://www.orientdb.org/) for the\r\nAndroid platform.\r\n\r\nCurrently the port removes all server implementations as they use the\r\n`javax.management.*` package, which is not part of the Android classpath.\r\nThe port is designed to be used in conjunction with the \r\n[blueprints-android](https://github.com/wuman/blueprints-android) library.\r\n\r\nCurrently only the following modules are ported:\r\n\r\n* orient-android-commons\r\n* orientdb-android-core\r\n* orientdb-android-enterprise\r\n* orientdb-android-client\r\n* orientdb-android-nativeos\r\n* orientdb-android-object\r\n* orientdb-android-tools\r\n* orientdb-android-distribution\r\n\r\nNote that orientdb-android is still under development and  only \r\n`orient-android-commons` and `orientdb-android-core` have been used and tested \r\nin the wild, so use it at your own risk. We welcome contributions and feedbacks.\r\n\r\nThe current release of orientdb-android is 1.1.0.0, which is in line with version\r\n1.1.0 of the upstream OrientDB. \r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding in Your Project\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to include orientdb-android in your projects:\r\n\r\n1. You can download the released jar file in the [Downloads section](https://github.com/wuman/orientdb-android/downloads).\r\n2. If you use Maven to build your project you can simply add a dependency to \r\n   the desired component of the library.\r\n\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.wu-man</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>orient[db]-android-*</artifactId>\r\n            <version>1.1.0.0</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction to OrientDB\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n[OrientDB](http://code.google.com/p/orient/) is an open source \r\n[NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) DBMS with both the features of \r\nDocument and Graph DBMS. It's written in Java and it's amazing fast: it can store \r\nup to 150,000 records per second on common hardware.\r\n\r\nOrientDB is in its core a [graph database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database),\r\nalthough it also offers the interface of a document database. When used a \r\ndocument database, the relationships are managed as in graph databases with \r\ndirect connections among records. You can traverse entire or part of trees and \r\ngraphs of records in few milliseconds.\r\n\r\nTo see how OrientDB compares with other databases, take a look at\r\n\r\n* [GraphDB comparison](http://code.google.com/p/orient/wiki/GraphDBComparison)\r\n* [DocumentDB comparison](http://code.google.com/p/orient/wiki/DocumentDBComparison)\r\n\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking \r\nthe repository and sending a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Android porting contributor\r\n    * David Wu - <david@wu-man.com> - [http://blog.wu-man.com](http://blog.wu-man.com)\r\n* Original contributors to OrientDB\r\n    * Luca Garulli - <l.garulli@orientechnologies.com> - http://www.orientechnologies.com\r\n    * Luca Molino - <molino.luca@gmail.com>\r\n    * Andrey Lomakin - <lomakin.andrey@gmail.com> \r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2012 David Wu\r\n    Copyright 2010-2012 Luca Garulli (l.garulli--at--orientechnologies.com)\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","name":"Orientdb-android","note":"Don't delete this file!
